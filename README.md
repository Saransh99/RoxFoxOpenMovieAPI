CORS:- cross origin resourse sharing is enabled in this API so no need to make a proxy server or anything else
cors middleware:- this is the 3rd party middleware which we can use directly in the api so we don't need to write the middleware by ourself
--> we can write the cors middleware by specifying the req headers




// TODO:- 

-------------------  THis will be huge for the api -------------------------

-> we will add the google oAuth 2.0 authentication using passport.js
-> save the google profile in the mongodb database 
-> we will send the token to the google mail
